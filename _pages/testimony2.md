As you read through this page, I hope to share the joy and wonder I’ve found in God’s love and redemption—and perhaps inspire you to embrace that love for yourself.

Have you ever been treated to a kindness you didn’t deserve? That feeling captures, in a small way, what salvation means for humanity. But why do we need salvation? Because each of us has fallen short of God’s standard.

> “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”  
> *(Romans 3:23)*

Salvation came to us purely out of God’s love—even while we were still in rebellion, living in the fallen state of human nature. Who chooses to love someone who continually betrays them? Yet, that’s exactly what God does. His love pursues us relentlessly.

Just as a mother longs to hold her child, God—the loving Father—longs for relationship with us. This was His purpose in creating us. We are so precious to Him that He gave His very best to bring us into His family. That love was expressed through the death of Jesus Christ, who bore the consequences of our wrongs on our behalf.

> “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”  
> *(Romans 5:8)*

Through this incredible act of love, we are welcomed into God’s family. The rebel becomes a child of God! Each member of His family is made new—as if they had never sinned—and is free to enjoy all the privileges of belonging to this glorious family.

This relationship with God is available to anyone. Just as He reached out to me, God is reaching out to you. His heart longs for you. Love is only complete when it is received. By putting your faith in Jesus and accepting His gift of love, you offer the most beautiful response.
