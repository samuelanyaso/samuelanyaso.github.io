I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Biostatistics Branch](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/bb) within the [Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about) at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/), working under the joint mentorship of [Jianxin Shi](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shi-jianxin) and [Paul Albert](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/albert-paul). 

I earned my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the [University of Florida](http://biostat.ufl.edu/) in 2023, advised by [Somnath Datta](https://www.somnathdatta.org/), and an M.S. in Mathematics from [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/math/), under [Dr. Partha Mukherjee](https://www.isical.ac.in/~psm/).

My research develops statistical and computational methods that integrate genetic, multi-omics, and spatial data with clinical outcomes to reveal mechanisms of disease risk and progression. I also design methodology for cluster-correlated data, informative cluster size, and univariate/multivariate time-to-event analysis.
