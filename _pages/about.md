I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Biostatistics Branch](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/tdrp/bb) within the [Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about) at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/). Currently, I have the privilege of working under the joint mentorship of [Dr. Jianxin Shi](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shi-jianxin) and [Dr. Paul Albert](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/albert-paul). My academic journey has been enriched by the guidance of [Dr. Somnath Datta](https://www.somnathdatta.org/) during my Ph.D. in [Biostatistics](http://biostat.ufl.edu/) at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/). Additionally, I hold a Master's degree in [Mathematics](https://www.boisestate.edu/math/) from [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Partha Mukherjee](https://www.isical.ac.in/~psm/).

My ongoing research is centered around the development of statistical methodologies tailored for the analysis of spatial heterogeneity of tumors, longitudinal microbiome data, and biological networks. A significant part of my focus is also dedicated to the creation of statistical methods for analyzing cluster-correlated data, informative cluster size, univariate and multivariate time-to-event data, statistical process control, as well as the analysis of large sequence data, and metagenomics.

During my doctoral training, I served as a biostatistician at the Brain Rehabilitation Research Center (BRRC) at the [NF/SG VHS Malcolm Randall VA Medical Center](https://www.va.gov/north-florida-health-care/locations/malcom-randall-department-of-veterans-affairs-medical-center/) in Gainesville, Florida. In this capacity, I provided statistical consultation and assistance for various trials and studies conducted at the BRRC. This experience allowed me to collaborate with clinicians and researchers from diverse disciplines, including physical therapy, brain rehabilitation science, hematology, and oncology.
