While reading this page, it's my prayer that you'd come to the saving knowledge of Christ. But before we dive in, let us take a quick look at a vital passage in scripture. In Apostle Paul's letter to the Ephesians, he writes,

"
And you, He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others (Ephesians 2:1-3).
"

The text above characterizes the natural state of a person, it is a vivid description of the man I was born to be, and it illustrates the unredeemed nature of every person born into this world. Broken, fallen, and sinful. Like many, I was born into a world of corruption; and morphed into more iniquity throughout my life. Have you ever wondered? Where do people learn the negative traits that continually lead them to trouble? For instance, I struggled with the habit of telling lies - to evade unpleasant situations and to make myself look good before others. But I never craved this habit; neither did my parents or teachers train me in this undesirable character. Well, this habit was a natural consequence of my birth into the corruption of this world and walking in its course. Inherently, we tend to walk in some unpleasant characteristics which we acknowledge are awful - greed, lustfulness, anger, and the never-ending list. Most times, we are remorseful after falling prey to our evil inclinations, but the sad thing is that reoccurrence of the detestable is typical. Hence, the Apostle says, we were dead in trespasses and fulfilled the desires of our carnal nature. Now, let's jump to the beautiful side.

"
But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 2:4-7). 
"

Herein lies the kernel of the gospel. By the mercy of God, I have been redeemed from a life of corruption unto a new life through Jesus Christ. That old nature that was subject to corruption is now dead, and in Christ Jesus, I am born anew unto everlasting life with the power over sin. I invite you to consider this path unto redemption. Primarily, acknowledge the struggle with your shortcomings, accept the love and forgiveness of God, and believe and walk in the authority of the redemptive power Christ has granted you. Please, reach out to me if you would like to know more. Ultimately, I pray you will be able to say along with me:

"
I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. (Galatians 2:20)
