### DyAEWMA

`DyAEWMA` (Adaptive EWMA control chart with a Dynamic Sampling Scheme) is an `R` package for estimating the average time to signal (ATS) of an adaptive EWMA chart with a dynamic sampling scheme or the average run length (ARL) of the adaptive EWMA chart.

The `R` packgage `DyAEWMA` is available [here](https://github.com/samuelanyaso/DyAEWMA) and a vignette that explains how to use the package can be found [here](http://samuelanyaso.github.io/files/DyAEWMA_vignette.pdf).

### metagenomic_data_analysis 
A suite of programs for the bioinformatics pre-processing and downstream analysis of raw sequence metagenomics data. The programs are available [here](https://github.com/samuelanyaso/metagenomic_data_analysis) and the article describing the implementation of the programs and methods can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-73351-3_3).

### pseudoReg-ICS
`R` [program](https://github.com/samuelanyaso/pseudoReg-ICS) for estimating the state occupation probability for cluster-correlated data from a multistate model. The program allows for adjusting for informative cluster size. A vignette that describes the implementation of the program, along with the application of pseudo-value regression for estimating the effects of available covariates on the SOP is available [here](https://github.com/samuelanyaso/pseudoReg-ICS/blob/master/README.pdf).

### mspack2
`R` [package]([https://github.com/samuelanyaso/pseudoReg-ICS](https://github.com/samuelanyaso/mspack2)) for estimating several temporal functions (e.g. state occupation probabilities) for current-status data from of a general multistate model. The code estimates the SOP for the setting where the current-status data is either uncorrelated or cluster-correlated. The vignette for this package is avaiable [here](https://github.com/samuelanyaso/mspack2/blob/master/mspack2_vignette.pdf).
